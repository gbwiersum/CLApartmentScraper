The area developed in the early 1800s, when a public green space was designed by Jens Jensen, a landscape architect. Today, Logan Square Park is located in the heart of the neighborhood, wrapped by Logan Boulevard and divided by Milwaukee Avenue.  Bicycle-friendly Logan Square is all about living local, from its restaurants that use only locally-farmed produce to local craft breweries to local artists in galleries. With its wide sidewalks and compact design, Logan Square is very walkable. If you choose a Logan Square apartment, you'll be about five miles from Downtown Chicago, with easy access to mass transit -- just hop on the L's Blue Line from the Logan Square Blue Line Station and you'll be downtown in minutes.

Located on the Northwest Side of the city and bordered by the Chicago River on the right, Irving Park is home to a rich mix of architectural styles, sub-cultures, and cuisines. Farmed by European immigrants over a century ago and later established as a suburban settlement, the community has gone through several changes and continues to transform itself to this day. Architecture buffs can enjoy strolls among historic districts where various types of houses are on display, such as bungalows, farmhouses, Queen Anne, Victorian, and Italianate homes. Residents who love exercising have plenty of facilities to choose from, although they can also enjoy the fresh air at one of many neighborhood parks. Those who enjoy thrifting and hunting for vintage finds have four discount stores to frequent and several local shops to support as well. Finally, foodies can grab quick bites to eat, have a drink with friends after work, or challenge their taste buds at any number of exotic restaurants. Thanks to great public transportation (3 CTA Blue Line stops & buses), it is more than easy to explore other parts of the city, or head to the suburbs and beyond via the Kennedy Expressway nearby.   Things to Do 	Recreation: McFetridge Sports Center, DMSFit, Irving Park YMCA, Arabesque Dance & Fitness Studio, and many neighborhood parks – Horner, Independence, Mayfair, California, Kilbourn, Kolmar Playlot, Keeler Gardens, & Merchant Park Community Garden  	Architecture: Villa Historic District & The Steven A. Race Mansion  	Culture: Irving Park Historical Society, Irish American Heritage Center, Latvian Folk Art Museum, & Windy City Playhouse (performing arts)  	Shopping: Bob’s Blues & Jazz Market, The Music Store, Bloodshot Records, Bonnie Flower Shop, Lincoln Antique Mall, Brew & Grow (hydroponics), Capone’s Liquor & Food, and several discount stores (Unique, Village Discount, Dollar Tree, & Bargains In A Box)  	Services: The Cat’s Meow Beauty (salon) & Hot Nails  	Groceries: Tony’s Fresh Market, Cermak Fresh Market, & Independence Park Farmers Market  	For Foodies: Susie’s Drive-Thru (cash only), Smoque BBQ, Old Irving Brewing Co.

Both a biker’s and walker’s paradise, this community is host to excellent public transportation as well, providing residents and visitors alike with opportunities to explore local hot spots and venture out whenever they want to. Home to several distinct neighborhoods, including popular Wicker Park and Ukrainian Village, West Town is known throughout the city for having some of the best eats, boutiques, and art galleries. Locally recognized for its eclectic personality, the community owes much of its current popularity to the numerous immigrant groups that have called it home throughout several generations. Nowadays, West Town draws from its past while gradually evolving into something new. Cultural centers, ethnic museums, and diverse restaurants continue to draw in anyone who appreciates being surrounded by so much history, so make yourself at home! Catch a show at one of several local theaters if you enjoy the performing arts, hunt for one-of-a-kind vintage treasures, and end the night with a drink at a live music venue, or even while listening to a jukebox with your friends.
